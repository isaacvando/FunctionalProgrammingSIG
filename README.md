# Functional Programming SIG
I led this special interest group through the Mizzou Computing Association for the 22-23 academic year. In the first semester we did a thorough introduction to FP by covering the key parts of Haskell. I used Jupyter notebooks for the first semester of Haskell which is why 80% of the repo is Jupyter. 

In the second semester once we had established the basics of FP, we took a tour of several other functional languages and the unique features they offer. We covered Unison, Elm, Clojure, Dhall, and Roc.

## Haskell Resources
- [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) - A delightful introduction to Haskell. 
- [Exercism Haskell Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/haskell) - A wonderful way to practice solving problems with Haskell. 
- [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/) - A book on Haskell with lots of information on applications of Haskell and commonly used libraries.
- [Category Theory For Programmers](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_) - A great way to dive into a fascinating part of the mathematical foundation behind Haskell, Category Theory! Much of this can be understood without a huge amount of mathematical experience. 
- [The Dao of Functional Programming](https://github.com/BartoszMilewski/Publications/blob/master/TheDaoOfFP/DaoFP.pdf) - I don't quite know but it looks great!
- [Category Theory In Context](https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf) - A more traditional treatment of Category Theory. 
- [Haskell Download Instructions](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/)
- [Replit](https://replit.com/languages/haskell) - A no install way to run Haskell (and other) code.
